              <p>
                For the first time in 20 years, Portlanders are getting a detailed look at the damage
                 that will be caused by a catastrophe we all know is coming - 
                 a major earthquake striking the metro area - and the prospects are grim.

            <p> An earthquake is a sudden and rapid shaking of the ground
               caused by the shifting of rocks deep underneath the earth's surface. 
               Earthquakes can happen without warning and result in injuries and 
               damage to property and roads.
